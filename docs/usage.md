Adjust the "temperature" setting (0.0 to 1.0):
- **Lower values** (0.0-0.3): More consistent, deterministic responses
- **Medium values** (0.4-0.7): Balanced creativity and coherence
- **Higher values** (0.8-1.0): More creative, varied, and unpredictable responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Errors

If you see "API key not configured" errors:
1. Check that your .env file contains the correct API key
2. Verify that the key hasn't expired
3. Restart the application after making changes to the .env file

#### Database Issues

If conversations aren't saving properly:
1. Check permissions on the `~/.zerocode-llm-chat` directory
2. If the database becomes corrupted, you can delete the `chat_history.db` file (note: this will erase all conversations)

#### Model Not Found Errors

If you receive "model not found" errors:
1. Verify that you have the correct API key for the selected provider
2. Check that the model you're trying to use is available with your subscription
3. Model names and versions may change; check the provider's documentation

### Data Locations

- **Configuration**: `.env` file in the application directory
- **Database**: `~/.zerocode-llm-chat/chat_history.db` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\Users\YourUsername\.zerocode-llm-chat\chat_history.db` (Windows)
- **Exports**: Saved to your Downloads folder by default

## Electron Usage

### Using the Electron Version

If you're using the Electron desktop version:

1. Installation is simplified - just download and run the installer for your platform
2. API keys are stored in the application's secure storage
3. The database is stored in the application's data directory
4. Updates can be installed automatically

### Converting from Streamlit to Electron

For developers looking to package this as an Electron application:

1. The SQLite database can be easily relocated to the Electron app's data directory
2. The UI is responsive and will work well in an Electron window
3. Consider implementing a secure storage solution for API keys
4. Add a configuration page in the Electron app for API key management

## Advanced Features

### Custom Database Location

To use a custom location for the database, modify `src/db/db_manager.py` to specify your preferred path.

### Adding New Model Providers

Developers can extend the `src/llm/chat_client.py` file to add support for additional providers.
